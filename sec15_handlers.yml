  # 'notify' is the way to call a handler if any change is made by current task
  # Handlers are tasks that only run when notified
  # Each handler should have a globally unique name
  # e.g. you may want to restart a service if a task updates the configuration of that service,
  #   but not if the configuration is unchanged
